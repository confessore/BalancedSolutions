            <p>With Android and iOS, there's an app for that... and if there isn't, we can make an app for that!</p>
            <p>We use Xamarin to build our mobile applications because your app can be written once and deployed for Android and/or iOS devices.</p>
            <p>By using the Model View ViewModel Controller pattern, we can organize and present data in a visually dynamic fashion.</p>
